I'm Paul, a second year PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen. I'm supervised by Jes Frellsen and Michael Riis Andersen. 

I'm interested in all things generative models such as VAE, EBMs, GANs, but with a special focus on diffusion models and the theory behind them (stochastic processes, optimal transports, differential equations, etc.). Recently I have been working at reducing the variance of score based models' gradients. I'm keen now on working on discrete diffusion and their application to text and protein modelling.

A short time-line of what I have been up to the recent years:
- **2022 - 2024**: PhD student in Copenhagen working on Generative Models
- **2020 - 2021**: Twelve months internship at AWS AI Labs in Berlin under Michael Bohlke-Schneider & Tim Januschowski
- **March - Sep 2020**: Six months internship at Siemens Healthineers in Princeton, NJ under Mariappan Nadar & Boris Mailhé
- **2018 - 2020**: MSc at EPFL studying all things Data Science
- **2016 - 2020**: MSc at CentralSupélec in Electrical Engineering
- **2013 - 2016**: Preparatory Classes at Lycee Chaptal in Paris
