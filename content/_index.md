> Open for internship, please reach out if you think I could be a good fit for your team!

I'm Paul, a third year PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen. I'm supervised by [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org) and [Michael Riis Andersen](https://michaelriis.github.io). 

I'm interested in all things generative models such as VAE, EBMs, GANs, but with a special focus on diffusion models and the theory behind them (stochastic processes, optimal transports, differential equations, etc.). Recently I have been working at reducing the variance of score based models' gradients. I'm now working on guiding and sampling from discrete diffusion models. Check out my publications to see what I've been up to!

A short time-line of what I have been up to the recent years:

- **September 2025 - February 2026**: Excited to join [Natalie Schluter's](https://natschluter.github.io/) team at Apple MLR for a research internship!
- **June - August 2025**: Research internship at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK. Got to work on some really cool diffusion project with Jannes Gladrow, Heiner Kremer and Fabian Falck (soon out ;) ). 
- **April 2025**: Went to Singapore to present our work on Debiasing guidance for discrete diffusion. It has been selected for an oral presentation at the ICLR 2025 [FPI workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/fpiworkshop/about)! Really exciting work, check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06079)!
- **May - July 2024**: Visitied [Carl Henrik Ek](http://carlhenrik.com/) at University of Cambridge
- **2022 - 2026**: PhD student in Copenhagen working on Generative Models
- **2020 - 2021**: Twelve months internship at AWS AI Labs in Berlin under Michael Bohlke-Schneider & Tim Januschowski
- **March - Sep 2020**: Six months internship at Siemens Healthineers in Princeton, NJ under Mariappan Nadar & Boris Mailhé
- **2018 - 2020**: MSc at EPFL studying all things Data Science
- **2016 - 2020**: MSc at CentralSupélec in Electrical Engineering
- **2013 - 2016**: Preparatory Classes at Lycee Chaptal in Paris
