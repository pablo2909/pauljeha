> Open for internship, please reach out if you think I could be a good fit for your team!

I'm Paul, a third year PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen. I'm supervised by [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org) and [Michael Riis Andersen](https://michaelriis.github.io). 

I'm interested in all things generative models such as VAE, EBMs, GANs, but with a special focus on diffusion models and the theory behind them (stochastic processes, optimal transports, differential equations, etc.). Recently I have been working at reducing the variance of score based models' gradients. I'm now on working on guiding and sampling from discrete diffusion models. Check out my publications to see what I've been up to!

- **May - July 2024**: Visitied [Carl Henrik Ek](http://carlhenrik.com/) at University of Cambridge
- **2022 - 2024**: PhD student in Copenhagen working on Generative Models
- **2020 - 2021**: Twelve months internship at AWS AI Labs in Berlin under Michael Bohlke-Schneider & Tim Januschowski
- **March - Sep 2020**: Six months internship at Siemens Healthineers in Princeton, NJ under Mariappan Nadar & Boris Mailhé
- **2018 - 2020**: MSc at EPFL studying all things Data Science
- **2016 - 2020**: MSc at CentralSupélec in Electrical Engineering
- **2013 - 2016**: Preparatory Classes at Lycee Chaptal in Paris
